== A quick-n-dirty visualizer for Makefiles ==

DISCLAIMER: I've spent an hour to visualize the Makefile I needed. 
            So, sorry if it won't work for you.

=== DESCRIPTION ===
makefile2dot has been written to visualize Makefiles, e.g. GNU make Makefile. 
It is written in Python and implies that you have Python and GraphViz "dot" utility installed:

sudo apt-get install graphviz
sudo apt-get install python

=== USAGE ===

	makefile2dot <Makefile >out.dot
or
	makefile2dot <Makefile |dot -Tpng > out.png
